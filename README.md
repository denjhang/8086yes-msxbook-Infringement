 Recording a shameless 8086yes infringement project  
I can only describe MSXBook and 8086yes/8086 store as ridiculous and shameless. They have shamelessly changed the name of MSXBook to development platform and deleted all content related to MSX.ðŸ˜…   
MSXBook shamelessly copied the classic design of uMSX, even the color of the side ports is the same, can you change the color? And I found that they registered the MSX trademark, did they get permission from the MSX Foundation?ðŸ˜…
